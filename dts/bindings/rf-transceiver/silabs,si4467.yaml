properties:
    nirq-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Per default, the interrupt pin nIRQ of the Si4467 is active low input
        on the MCU.

    sdn-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        The shutdown (SDN) pin of the Si4467 is active high.

    gpio-0-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The MCU pin connected to the Si4467 GPIO 0

    gpio-1-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The MCU pin connected to the Si4467 GPIO 1

    gpio-2-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The MCU pin connected to the Si4467 GPIO 1

    gpio-3-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The MCU pin connected to the Si4467 GPIO 3

    xtal-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Clock frequency of XTAL in Hz.

    xtal-capacitor-tune-value:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Clock crystal capacitor tune value.

        This controls the capacitance of the internal capacitors for the
        crystal oscillator. The range is from 0 to 0x7f inclusive and each LSB
        step corresponds to ~70 fF change in capacitance. The ideal value must
        be determined experimentally and it can be left blank if individual
        calibration per device is used.

    rx-rssi-offset:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        RSSI offset in RX path due to analog front-end. Subtracted from RSSI
        value as reported by the Si4467 transceiver to get corrected value.
